# 👋 Hi, I'm Viktor

I completed my PhD in Computer Vision and Mathematics in January 2026. My research topic was **Algebraic Methods in 3D Computer Vision**, focusing on solving minimal problems efficiently for geometric vision tasks.

During my PhD, I was working at the intersection of mathematics, computer vision, and 3D reconstruction, developing fast and reliable solvers for minimal problems (realized by multivariate polynomial systems) arising in Structure-from-Motion pipelines. By applying tools from various fields of applied mathematics (such as algebraic geometry, representation theory, etc.), I was designing algorithms that were capable of decomposing these minimal problems into simpler, easier-to-solve pieces. The goal of my PhD was to connect deep mathematical theory and practical computer vision applications, which I accomplished successfully.
