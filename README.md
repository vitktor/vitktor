# 👋 Hi, I'm Viktor

I completed my PhD in Computer Vision and Mathematics in January 2026. My research **focused on Algebraic Methods in 3D Computer Vision**, solving minimal problems efficiently for geometric vision tasks.

During my PhD, I was working at the intersection of mathematics, computer vision, and 3D reconstruction, developing fast and reliable solvers for minimal problems (realized by multivariate polynomial systems) arising in Structure-from-Motion pipelines. By applying tools from algebraic geometry and representation theory, I was designing algorithms that were capable of simplifying these minimal problems and connect deep mathematical theory with practical vision applications.
